## 📋 Disc Storage

⬛ The last 10 drawn combinations need also be shown on the screen, along with their draws time. The last 100 winning combinations, and their draw times need to be persisted to disk. 

## 📋 CSV File

⬛ When Export All is pressed then all the previous drawn combinations from the persistence store are presented to the user as a CSV file.
